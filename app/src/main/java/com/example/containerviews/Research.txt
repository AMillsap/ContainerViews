1. ListView uses eager loading while recycleView uses lazy loading. ListView uses an array adapter to control
    the rendering and population of the data while recycleView uses a recycleView adapter which uses an internal
    class. RecycleView uses layout managers to control rendering as well as how swiping will work.
2. Lazy loading is when you only initialize an object at the point that you need it.
3. It is a customizable UI element that separates each item in the list of the recycler view
4. It is a method that enables you to access each listView item without having to look it up. It lets you
    not have to use the function findViewById() as much.
5. You first have to attach it to the RecyclerView. Then you are able to override the onMove,
    onSwiped, or onChildDraw functions to be able reposition items.
